      <p>Here is a recap of Season 1...</p>
      <p>In the quiet town of Hawkins, Indiana, a young boy named Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) goes missing. Left behind are his distraught mother, Joyce (Winona Ryder), and his group of super nerdy friends, Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin). At the same time, Will's friends encounter a young, mute girl, Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), who has mysteriously turned up in their small town. As the show evolves, Mike, Dustin, Lucas and Eleven begin a clandestine search for Will, ending up in a much larger and spookier conspiracy. Deep below the Hawkins National Laboratory, Department of Energy official Dr. Martin Brenner (Matthew Modine) was secretly conducting a CIA experiment on humans. One of the subjects was pregnant, giving birth to a girl named Jane, later known as Eleven. As a result of the experimentation, Eleven was born with psychic abilities. Her lack of control over her powers led to a space-time continuum allowing a terrifying monster, nicknamed the Demogorgon by Mike and pals, to enter Earth and wreak havoc in Hawkins. Eleven and her precocious friends beat the Demogorgon by the end of Season 1, but not without sacrifice: Eleven seemingly died in the climactic battle. The good news: Will safely returned home from demon's parallel dimension, the Upside Down. But did he really return? -©Newsgeek</p>

      <p>A recap of Season 2...(Yes I know it's alot)</p>
      <p>Despite returning from the Upside Down in season one, Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) has been unable to shake his connection to this shadow dimension. It turns out that he's being targeted by a massive smoke monster of sorts, nicknamed the Mind Flayer by Mike (Finn Wolfhard) and friends. A third of the way through the season, the Mind Flayer possesses Will, turning him into an unwitting "spy," all while sowing roots throughout the underground of Hawkins in an apparent plan to bring the Upside Down right-side up. For their part, Sheriff Hopper (David Harbour) and Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder) are incredibly proactive in the new fight against the Upside Down. Hopper is the one who discovers the subterranean threat spreading underneath Hawkins, while Joyce immediately senses trouble within her son and sets about unraveling the meaning behind the "shadow in the sky," which she's able to see thanks to the help of a video recording and some tracing paper.  Far away from all of this action: Eleven, who has spent the time between seasons one and two living in a cabin deep within the Hawkins forest, with Hopper serving as her secret guardian. Eleven gets frustrated with Hopper's overprotective rules and breaks out on her own, leading her to meet her own mother, learn more about the experiments at Hawkins Lab, and even meet one of the other members of the program: Kali (Linnea Berthelson), also known as "Eight," with the power to make people see anything she wants them to see. Eleven briefly joins Kali and her band of outcasts on their quest to kill everyone associated with the Hawkins program, but she eventually leaves because she senses the growing danger back home in Hawkins. While Eleven's away from her friends, another new girl enters the scene: Max (Sadie Sink), a skateboarding arcade wizard who immediately draws the infatuation of Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo). The group comes to accept Max, even if it takes Mike longer than the others before he's on board. (Eleven, for what it's worth, still needs some convincing.) Lucas and Max grow close over the course of the season, even leading to a kiss between them in the final scene at the Snow Ball. Don't feel sad for poor Dustin; he gets to dance with Nancy (Natalia Dyer) at the end of the day. Speaking of Nancy, she's caught in a temporary love triangle of her own, beginning the season dating Steve Harrington (Joe Keery). Their relationship ends around the same time Nancy and Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton) team together to seek justice for Barb (!!!), which they manage to achieve by watering down the truth of the season one story and sending it to numerous newspapers around the country. By the end of the season, Nancy and Jonathan are a romantic item, and their actions have caused the Hawkins lab to shut down due to public scrutiny. As for Steve, he gets one of the best and least expected stories of anyone this season: joining forces with Dustin and the rest of the kids as their veritable babysitter. The baseball bat with nails in it comes along for the ride, of course, which he thankfully doesn't need to use when he gets into a season finale fight against Billy (Dacre Montgomery), the new bad boy in town. The best part of it all: Steve shares the secrets behind his awesome hair with Dustin, which pays off in incredible fashion at the Snow Ball. The season winds down with all roads converging on the same mission: Eleven returns to Hawkins and finally reunites with Mike, just in time to use her telekinetic powers to destroy the Mind Flayer's reach from the Upside Down. Unfortunately, she arrives too late to save Bob Newby (Sean Astin), Joyce's new boyfriend who ends up getting killed by the "demodogs," the four-legged monsters who share a hive-mind attachment with the Mind Flayer. At least Will finally seems free of his connection to the Upside Down, once the portal closes, and after his loved ones are able to essentially burn the possession out of him. -©THR</p>
